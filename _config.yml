# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values

# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

title: David Flowers Memorial Bike Tour
email: stephenssspol@gmail.com
description: >- # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
  We hold this event every year to remember the life of David Flowers. 
  He was in no way a professional bike rider (in fact he often rode in his jean shorts!) but he 
  enjoyed riding and connecting with his family and church members. This has been crafted
  for registry and information about the events.
